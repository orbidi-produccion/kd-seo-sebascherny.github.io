                In this project the client was a startup whose product's concept was facilitating companies 
                with big and complex codebases some code changes done by developers that were very routinary and well-defined, 
                such that and algorithm could do it (like update a library and change all appearances of `Class.method()` to `Class.improved_method()`).

                <label>
                    I developed different scripts for some specific requests that could then be generalized so that 
                    possibly new requests in the future would use at least some parts of the scripts.

                <label>
                    The code had to be as standardize as possible among the different scripts and employees, because the idea 
                    was to send our generic scripts to an LLM (like Claude) to learn from them and be able to create new scripts for 
                    new requests (maybe combining the existing ones or even creating a new one following the structure).

                <br />
                <br />
                <label>
                    Since our code was changing constantly because of the startup's stage, I took the lead in testing, 
                    so that any change that would affect previous scripts was guaranteed to be backward compatible, and if not, 
                    the test would make us see why not and either change the test or fix the code.
